# ML-Application-Detecting-Window-Open-Events-in-Smart-Homes-using-Temperature-Sensor-Data-checkpoint 

Smart homes, driven by IoT devices, are enhancing comfort and energy efficiency. A key aspect is detecting window open events to optimize heating, cooling, and ventilation systems. Traditional rule-based methods for detecting open windows, like temperature thresholds, often lack accuracy in real-world scenarios. 

To address this, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based approach using temperature sensor data to detect window open events. Our ML models, trained on diverse real-world data, accurately identify window states, improving energy efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing comfort while promoting sustainable living.

We used a dataset file (smart_home_window_data.csv) for this project.

We compiled and executed this project in Anaconda's Jupyter Notepad in python

We compared two machine learning models (Decision Tree Classifier and Random forest Classifier) to check which one gives most accurate results.

The results show us a comparison between the 2 models and give us the status of the windows.
